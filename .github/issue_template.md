Thanks for reporting an issue! People like you help me make AREPL better.

There are no complicated reporting guidelines here, but the more info, the better!

Things like operating system, python version (python --version from terminal) are helpful.

If you want to be REALLY helpful you can run the VSCode command "Developer: Open Log File...", choose Extension Host, and copy the file here. Posting the python code you put in arepl could also be helpful.
